# Data Storage Review

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Branch:** `feat/review-data-storage`
**Scope:** Receipt database, statistics, extension statistics

---

## Current Architecture

The storage layer has three cooperating subsystems:

```
DB_ENGINE               ← orchestrator, owns everything below
  ├─ DB_STORAGE         ← receipt persistence (.DAT + .IDX)
  │   └─ IndexCache     ← LRU batching over index entries
  ├─ DB_STATISTICS      ← per-turn accumulators (.STA)
  ├─ DB_EXT_STATISTICS  ← STPro extension stats (.STA)
  └─ STM2               ← battery-backed SRAM (crash recovery bridge)
```

Each turn produces one set of file families. They live in the app directory and get renamed on `Archive()`:

| Turn | Files | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Current | `RX.DAT` + `RX.IDX` + `RX.STA` | Normal receipts + stats |
| Current (STPro) | `RXX.DAT` + `RXX.IDX` + `RXX.STA` | Extension receipts + stats |
| Archived | `RX<TURN>_<N>.DAT`/`.IDX`/`.STA` | Previous-turn data |

---

## Receipt Database (`DB_STORAGE`)

### Format: Dual flat binary files

**.DAT** — sequential record file.
```
[DataHeader] [Receipt_0] [Receipt_1] ... [Receipt_N]
```
`DataHeader` = `FILE_HEADER` (0x40 bytes, v3) + tax/round config (~26 bytes).
`Receipt` = 111-byte packed struct with `MagicNumber=0x6719`.

**.IDX** — sparse index file.
```
[IndexHeader] [IndexEntry_0] [IndexEntry_1] ...
```
`IndexHeader` = `FILE_HEADER` + `NumOfEntries`/`LowerNumber`/`HigherNumber` + 0x20 padding.
`IndexEntry` = `MagicNumber` + `Number`(long) + `BoothNumber`(int) + `SeekPos`(long).

### Receipt Struct (111 bytes)

```
Offset  Size  Field
------  ----  -----
 0      2     MagicNumber (0x6719)       ← validity check
 2      4     Number (long)
 6      2     Tag (enum: TEL/SPECIAL_TEL/TELEX/FAX/CARD/OTHER)
 8      2     Stat (bitfield: Cooked,Manual,Printed,Archived,Paid,CallAttr,Extension,Deleted)
10      2     ExtendedStat
12      4     Date (int, packed)
16      4     Time (int, packed)
20      2     BoothNumber
22     21     CityName (char[21])
43     17     Phone || Cards[4] || Minutes (union)
60      2     Amount || Tariff (union)
62      4     ElapsedTime (long)
66      8     ValuePerMin (double)
74      8     CeilMin (double)
82      2     Percent (int)
84      8     Value (double)
92      8     Tax (double)
100     8     Tax2 (double)
108     8     DDummy (double)
     = 111
```

### Index Cache

Not a full B-tree — a flat sliding window of `IndexEntry` records read from the `.IDX` file in configurable batches. `Find(number, boothNumber)` binary-searches the cache. Cache miss → read another batch from disk.

### Key observations

1. **sizeof-based serialization.** Every struct goes to disk via `write(fd, &struct, sizeof(struct))`. Any compiler change, alignment tweak, or field addition shifts binary offsets and corrupts the file. This is the exact same fragility we just eliminated from `st.cfg`.

2. **No cross-file checksums.** The `CheckSum` field in `FILE_HEADER` is declared but **never computed** — always written as zero, never validated.

3. **Read-only validity = magic number.** Each `Receipt` is considered valid if `MagicNumber == 0x6719`. No CRC on the record body. A single-bit flip in the Number field could silently produce a wrong receipt.

4. **16-bit DOS assumptions baked in.** `sizeof(UINT)=2`, `sizeof(int)=2`, `sizeof(long)=4`. Enums are 2 bytes. `double` alignment is Borland's default (no `-a` flag). All little-endian, no endian marker.

5. **Logical deletes.** `Stat.Deleted` is set to true. Records are never physically removed except during `Repair()`. This means file sizes grow monotonically.

6. **Repair() is the sole recovery path.** Linear-scans the entire `.DAT`, validates `MagicNumber` per record, deduplicates via a 5000-entry sliding book, writes a clean `.DAT` and rebuilds `.IDX` from scratch. Works, but on 100M-record files this is slow.

7. **Crash recovery via STM2.** The STM2 battery-backed SRAM holds a circular queue of recent receipts + statistics snapshots. On `BAD_SHUTDOWN`, `DB_ENGINE::Recover()` replays missing receipts from STM2 into storage. This is reliable on real hardware but untested in DOSBox-X (no STM2 emulation).

8. **MAX_RECEIPTS = 100,000,000.** An artifact of turning over a 32-bit Number range. `long` wraps at ~2.1 billion, but `MAX_RECEIPTS` is `100000000`. In practice, files will hit filesystem size limits (2GB FAT32) well before the record count limit.

---

## Statistics (`DB_STATISTICS`)

### Format: Single flat binary file

**.STA** layout:
```
[FILE_HEADER (0x40)] [DS_ENTRY[5]] [DS_DOUBLEPRNENTRY[2]] [DS_CELLULARENTRY[5]]
```

### DS_ENTRY structure

Five entries, each holding per-type accumulation at a period level:

```
DS_ENTRY[5]   →   YEAR, MONTH, WEEK, DAY, TURN
└─ ITEM[6]    →   TEL, SPECIAL_TEL, FAX, TELEX, CARD, OTHER
   ├─ Receipts (int)
   ├─ TalkMin (double)
   ├─ PaidMin (double)
   ├─ Value (double)
   └─ Tax (double)
```

Plus: `DS_DOUBLEPRNENTRY[2]` (per-printer-channel costs), `DS_CELLULARENTRY[5]` (cellular breakdown, same hierarchy).

### Key observations

1. **In-memory accumulation, periodic flush.** Statistics are accumulated in RAM during the turn. `Flush()` does `lseek + write` overwriting the entire `.STA` in place. If the app crashes between `Add()` and `Flush()`, the `.STA` file shows stale data.

2. **STM2 mirrors live-turn stats.** Every 5 ticks, the current DS_ENTRY[DS_TURN] snapshot is written to STM2. On recovery, `Repair()` rebuilds all 5 periods from the full receipt database, so the STM2 mirror is mostly a safety net.

3. **No time-series, only period-boundary snapshots.** Statistics reset at date boundaries (day/week/month/year rollover in `Update()`). You cannot answer "how many calls in the last 3 hours" — only "how many in the current turn/day/week."

4. **Week boundary heuristic is culture-specific.** Week reset uses a `DOW - 1 >= 4` condition derived from Thu-Sun vs Mon-Wed. Hardcoded.

5. **File is fragile.** Same sizeof issues as the database. Backward-compat sections (`Dummy` fields) are silently zero-initialized on truncation.

## Risks Summary

| Risk | Severity | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sizeof`-based serialization | HIGH | Any toolchain change corrupts all data | Packed structs + static asserts only help against C++ ABI drift, not field reordering |
| No checksums | MEDIUM | Silent data corruption on bit rot | CRC field exists but is never computed |
| 16-bit DOS lock-in | HIGH | Cannot port to 32/64-bit without migration | `int=4` on modern compilers doubles every enum and int field size |
| Flat index (no B-tree) | LOW | Linear scan on cache miss; fine for 50K records | Pre-existing limit, not hitting today |
| Logical deletes | LOW | Unbounded file growth on heavy edits | Repair() compacts, but must be run explicitly |
| No transaction log | MEDIUM | Inconsistent .DAT/.IDX/.STA after hard crash | STM2 bridges the gap on real hardware; DOSBox-X has none |
| Statistics loss on crash | MEDIUM | Current turn stats may be stale | Repair() rebuilds from receipt database |

---

## Improvement Proposals

### Proposal A: Structural improvements to the current format (minimal risk)

Keep the existing binary format but harden it:

1. **Compute the CheckSum field.** A simple CRC-32 per file header catches accidental corruption and gives confidence on cross-platform copies.

2. **Add a per-record CRC trailer.** Append 2 bytes of CRC-16 after each `Receipt` and `IndexEntry`. Validate on read. Adds ~2% overhead. Backward-compatible: old files read as CRC-0 (skip check).

3. **Physical deletes on Archive.** Compact `.DAT` on `Archive()` instead of just renaming files. Removes logically-deleted records.

4. **Statistics snapshot at every boundary.** Not just flush-on-request — auto-flush `.STA` when `Update()` detects a period boundary.

5. **Endianness marker in FILE_HEADER.** A magic byte (`0x0E 0x0B` or similar) lets a future cross-platform reader detect byte-order mismatches.

**Effort:** 3-5 days. **Risk:** Low. Backward-compatible with existing .DAT/.STA files.

### Proposal B: Abstract storage layer with pluggable backends (medium risk)

Introduce a virtual `IStorage` interface so the receipt lifecycle is decoupled from the binary format:

```
ReceiptStorage   ← interface (Add/Get/Update/Delete/Enum/Repair)
  ├─ FlatFileStorage    ← current binary format (default)
  └─ [future: SqliteStorage, etc.]
```

This is the same pattern used to decouple `RT_ENGINE` / `DEMO_ENGINE` in the Template Method hierarchy. Benefits:

- Testable: mock `ReceiptStorage` in unit tests without touching real files
- Replaceable: swap in a SQLite backend later without touching `db_eng.cpp`
- Observable: a logging proxy between interface and implementation

**Effort:** 5-8 days. **Risk:** Medium. Touches every receipt operation in control/engine.

### Proposal C: Replace with embedded SQLite (high effort, high payoff)

Port receipt storage + statistics to SQLite (via `sqlite3` amalgamation compiled under Open Watcom). One `.db` file replaces `.DAT` + `.IDX` + `.STA`:

- Atomic transactions — no .DAT/.IDX/.STA inconsistency possible
- Real time-series queries — "revenue last 3 hours" without Repair()
- Indexed — no IndexCache, no batch-size tuning
- Schema migration — `ALTER TABLE` replaces zero-init Dummy fields
- CRUD is ACID, not logical-delete-and-repair

**Statements the current logic would map to:**

```sql
-- Receipts (replaces .DAT + .IDX)
CREATE TABLE receipts (
    number      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    tag         INTEGER NOT NULL,
    stat        INTEGER NOT NULL,
    date        INTEGER NOT NULL,
    time        INTEGER NOT NULL,
    booth       INTEGER NOT NULL,
    city        TEXT,
    phone       TEXT,
    elapsed     INTEGER,
    ceil_min    REAL,
    percent     INTEGER,
    value       REAL NOT NULL,
    tax         REAL,
    tax2        REAL,
    created_at  TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

-- Statistics (replaces .STA)
CREATE TABLE statistics (
    period_type INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- YEAR/MONTH/WEEK/DAY/TURN
    period_key  TEXT NOT NULL,      -- '2026', '2026-06', '2026-W25', etc.
    service     INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- TEL/FAX/etc.
    receipts    INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    talk_min    REAL DEFAULT 0,
    paid_min    REAL DEFAULT 0,
    value       REAL DEFAULT 0,
    tax         REAL DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY (period_type, period_key, service)
);
```

**Effort:** 15-20 days. **Risk:** High. Requires Open Watcom toolchain + sqlite3 amalgamation compile. Crunch time if the goal is "working product" vs "learning exercise."

### Proposal D: CSV/JSON as canonical + binary cache (exotic)

Store receipts as append-only CSV lines (one line = one receipt). Periodically rebuild a binary index. SQLite already does this better — not recommended.

---

## Recommendation

**Phase 1 (Proposal A):** Compute CheckSum, add record CRC, compact on Archive, auto-flush statistics. 3-5 days, backward-compatible, buys integrity for free.

**Phase 2 (Proposal B):** Abstract `ReceiptStorage` / `StatisticsStorage` interfaces. 5-8 days. Enables testing, mock receipts, and a clean seam for Phase 3.

**Phase 3 (Proposal C):** Optionally replace the concrete impl with SQLite. Can be deferred indefinitely — Phase 1 + 2 already fix the integrity gaps and enable testing.

---

## Files Touched by Each Proposal

### Phase 1 — Structural hardening
- `src/db/dstorage.cpp` — compute/write/verify CRC; compact on Archive
- `src/db/dstatist.cpp` — auto-flush on period boundary
- `include/filehdr.h` — CRC-32 field (already exists, just populate it)
- `src/db/filehdr.cpp` — compute CRC on header write
- `include/receipt.h` — add CRC-16 trailer (optional extra field)
- `include/dstorage.h` — new `IndexEntry` field for CRC

### Phase 2 — Abstraction
- `include/istorage.h` — new `IReceiptStorage` / `IStatisticsStorage` interfaces
- `src/db/flatfile_storage.cpp` — current impl moved behind interfaces
- `src/db/mock_storage.cpp` — in-memory impl for testbeds
- `src/db/db_eng.cpp` — wire through factory instead of owning concrete
- `include/db_eng.h` — replace `DB_STORAGE *` with `IReceiptStorage *`

### Phase 3 — SQLite
- `vendor/sqlite/` — amalgamation (sqlite3.c + sqlite3.h)
- `src/db/sqlite_storage.cpp` — `IReceiptStorage` impl over SQLite
- `src/db/sqlite_statistics.cpp` — `IStatisticsStorage` impl
- `include/db_eng.h` — factory switch selects backend
- `util/migrate/` — tool to convert existing .DAT/.IDX/.STA to .db

## MiniDB: Embedded C89 Database Backend

MiniDB is a back-pocket replacement for FlatFileStorage that implements the
same `IReceiptStorage` / `IStatisticsStorage` interfaces but with a single
`.db` file, B-tree index, and rename-based atomic commit. It is **feasible**
under BCC 3.1 / Phar Lap 286 — every required language and OS feature is
available.

### Feasibility check

| Requirement | Available in BCC 3.1 / Phar Lap? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `long` (32-bit) | YES | Receipt numbers and seek positions fit in 32 bits. MAX_RECEIPTS = 100M < 2^31 |
| `double` (64-bit) | YES | Currency and tariff values stored as-is |
| `malloc`/`new` for page cache | YES | Phar Lap heap accessible via `malloc` (extended DOS, up to 16 MB) |
| POSIX `open`/`read`/`write`/`lseek` | YES | Phar Lap provides all DOS file I/O via `sys/types.h` / `sys/stat.h` / `fcntl.h` |
| `rename()` atomic on same volume | YES | DOS `rename()` is file-system-atomic on FAT32 and NT redirectors |
| `unlink()` | YES | Standard |
| No `long long` needed | YES | 32-bit `long` wraps at 2.1B; receipts max out at 100M |
| No `off_t` needed | YES | `lseek` takes `long`, file size < 2 GB |

### What MiniDB is not

MiniDB is **not** a relational database. There are no SQL strings, no query
planner, no schemas beyond a fixed set of record types. It is a **page-oriented
key-value store with B+tree indexing** — roughly the equivalent of a bespoke
Berkeley DB (dbm) for the 16-bit DOS target.

### Architecture

```
MiniDB (.db file)
├── Page 0:  DB Header (magic, page_size, root_page, sequence counter)
├── Page 1+: B+tree leaf pages (ordered receipt index)
├── Page N:  B+tree internal pages
├── Page M:  Statistics pages (fixed-location rows)
└── Tail:    Write-ahead area (rename-based commit frontier)
```

```
IReceiptStorage   ← interface (already exists)
  ├─ FlatFileStorage  ← existing, hardened (Phase 1)
  └─ MiniDBStorage   ← C89 B+tree on .db

IStatisticsStorage ← interface (already exists)
  ├─ FlatFileStatistics  ← existing, hardened
  └─ MiniDBStatistics   ← inline in same .db
```

### Page format (512 bytes = 1 DOS sector)

```
PAGE:
  OFFSET  SIZE  FIELD
  0       2     Magic (0xDBDB)
  2       2     PageType (0=internal, 1=leaf, 2=stats)
  4       2     NumEntries
  6       2     FreeSpace (offset of next free byte)
  8       2     RightSibling (page number, 0 = none)
  10      6     Reserved
  ─────────────────────────────────
  16     496    Payload (keys + data pointers)

LEAF ENTRY (each):
  key:     4 bytes (long receipt number)
  booth:   2 bytes (int)
  seek:    4 bytes (page number within .db, not file offset)
  size:  106 bytes (Receipt minus MagicNumber, inline?)
          → OR: 10 bytes (key + page ref), Receipt on dedicated data pages
```

**Two storage strategies for receipts:**

*In-row:* Store the full 111-byte `Receipt` directly in the leaf page entry.
~3-4 receipts per 512-byte page (after header + entry overhead). B-tree is
wider but data is single-seek.

| Receipts | Pages (in-row) | Pages (ref-only) |
|---|---|---|
| 1,000 | ~330 | 6 (refs) + 130 (data) |
| 10,000 | ~3,300 | 51 (refs) + 1,300 (data) |
| 100,000 | ~33,000 | 501 (refs) + 13,000 (data) |

*Ref-only:* Store just (key, booth, page#) in leaf entries. Receipts live on
dedicated 16-receipt data pages. 2 seeks for lookup (index → data), but the
index is much smaller — stays cached in memory longer. **Recommended.**

### Statistics storage

Allocate one dedicated page (or a small block of pages at a known page number)
for the five period accumulators. Stats are fixed-sized — `DS_ENTRY[5]` +
`DS_DOUBLEPRNENTRY[2]` + `DS_CELLULARENTRY[5]`. On `Flush()`, write the
in-memory copy to the stats page. On `Update()` boundary, write.

### Atomic commit sequence

MiniDB avoids torn-write corruption without a write-ahead log by using
**rename-based commit**:

1. Open `.db.new` for writing
2. Serialize every dirty page (header, changed index pages, stats page,
   new/receipt data pages) to `.db.new`
3. `Flush()` + `close()` `.db.new`
4. `rename(".db.new", ".db")` — atomic on DOS FAT32
5. Delete old `.db` (already replaced by the rename)

If the app crashes during step 2: `.db.new` is partial (harmless), `.db` is
untouched. Recovery: delete `.db.new` on next open.

If the app crashes during step 4: `.db.new` is complete, `.db` may or may not
have been replaced. Recovery: delete `.db`, rename `.db.new` → `.db`.

### B-tree parameters

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Page size | 512 bytes | DOS sector size — single `read()`/`write()` |
| Order (max keys) | 50 | Leaf: 50 × 10-byte entries = 500 bytes ≤ 496 payload |
| Min keys | 25 | = order/2 |
| Split strategy | First-fit, 50/50 split | Simplest, no rebalancing logic needed |
| Cache | LRU, 128 pages (64 KB) | Stays within ~50 KB for 10K records (ref-only) |
| File growth | Append-only (no free-page list) | Simplifies code; compaction on Archive |

### DB_ENGINE factory change

Current (after Phase 2):
```cpp
DB_ENGINE() {
    DBStorage    = new DB_STORAGE(...);
    DBStatistics = new DB_STATISTICS(...);
}
```

MiniDB:
```cpp
DB_ENGINE() {
    DBStorage    = new MiniDBStorage("rx.db");
    DBStatistics = new MiniDBStatistics("rx.db"); // same file
}
```

Or via a config flag:
```cpp
DB_ENGINE() {
    if (g_cfg->MINIDB) {
        DBStorage    = new MiniDBStorage("rx.db");
        DBStatistics = new MiniDBStatistics("rx.db");
    } else {
        DBStorage    = new DB_STORAGE(...);
        DBStatistics = new DB_STATISTICS(...);
    }
}
```

### Implementation plan

#### Phase M1: Infrastructure (3-4 days)

| Step | File | What |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `include/minidb/page.h` | `PageType`, `PageHeader` struct, slot layout |
| 2 | `include/minidb/btree.h` | B+tree split/insert/search/delete signatures |
| 3 | `src/db/minidb/btree.cpp` | B+tree core: insert, search, split, compact |
| 4 | `src/db/minidb/cache.cpp` | LRU page cache (128-slot, page-fault → disk read) |
| 5 | `src/db/minidb/commit.cpp` | Atomic commit sequence (write dirty → flush → rename) |
| 6 | `src/db/minidb/recover.cpp` | Startup recovery (delete orphaned `.db.new`) |

#### Phase M2: Storage implementation (5-7 days)

| Step | File | What |
|---|---|---|
| 7 | `src/db/minidb/receipt_storage.cpp` | `IReceiptStorage` impl over B+tree + data pages |
| 8 | `src/db/minidb/statistics.cpp` | `IStatisticsStorage` impl over fixed stats pages |
| 9 | `include/minidb_storage.h` | `MiniDBStorage : IReceiptStorage` |
| 10 | `include/minidb_statistics.h` | `MiniDBStatistics : IStatisticsStorage` |

#### Phase M3: Integration (2-3 days)

| Step | File | What |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | `src/db/db_eng.cpp` | Factory: config flag selects MiniDB vs FlatFile |
| 12 | `src/cfg.cpp` or `.ini` | Add `MINIDB=1` config key (default 0) |
| 13 | `util/migrate/` | One-shot converter: .DAT+.IDX → .db |
| 14 | Build + test | Build under all variants; run in DOSBox-X |

**Total estimated effort: 10-14 days** (one developer, BCC 3.1 target).

### Should we do it?

| Consideration | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Is it technically feasible? | **Yes.** BCC 3.1 can do everything required. |
| Will existing data migrate? | Yes — one-shot converter reads .DAT+.IDX, writes .db. |
| Is it backward-compatible? | Yes — switchable via MINIDB=0|1 in config. FlatFile is still default. |
| Does it fix the biggest remaining risk? | The Phase 1 CRC already closes the integrity gap. MiniDB adds atomic commit (replaces STM2 for recovery) and O(log n) lookups. |
| Does it add maintenance burden? | Yes — another bespoke format. The current FlatFile is simple to debug by hexdump; MiniDB's paged format is not. |
| Is it worth the effort vs. value? | The current system works for thousands of calls per turn. MiniDB only pays off if data volumes grow significantly or crash recovery without STM2 becomes critical. |

**Recommendation:** Implement only if either:
1. DOSBox-X users need crash-proof operation without STM2 emulation, OR
2. Receipt volumes exceed ~50,000 per turn (where flat index cache becomes slow)

Otherwise, the Phase 1 CRC + auto-flush + compact Archive already give integrity
equivalent to a simple DB without the maintenance cost of a paged B-tree format.
The abstraction layer (Phase 2) means MiniDB can be dropped in later with zero
caller changes — the interface seam is already cut.
